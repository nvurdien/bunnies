# bunnynet

Bunnynet is a democratic rabbit breed classification platform.



## Platform

Flask

SQLite

Python3.6


## TODO

* Hand-crafted autocomplete (probably using Levenshtein distance)
* Allow user upload
* Deep learning integration for predictions
* Prediction API

## Design choices:

* Image -> vote many-to-one, better than one-to-one, no extremely large and  sparse objects. 


### But seriously

This is a PET project, GET IT?
